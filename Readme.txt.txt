2. Both of us contributed equally as we did it together,

3.It is a java program and will run on any java compiler such as Eclipse, etc

4.String A contains the Anagrams, if some words are anagrams then it will display together in " [dog god] " a format like this.
  If a word isn't a anagram, then that word will be ignored while printing.

5.The syntax for HashMap was very tricky, we thought of using array, but after trial and error on both HashMap and array, we found HashMap to be better

6.We learnt about HashMap and a little bit of Array listing.

Thank you
